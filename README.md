# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`
- `species`

## Model

A Random Forest classifier was used to achieve high accuracy in classifying the Iris species.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set.
